# Pat's Cookbook
A multi-language cookbook of ready-to-use scripts, from quick fixes to full automation workflows.

## 📜 About
This repository is a curated collection of scripts and automation recipes I’ve written and organized by purpose they serve ranging from one-off utilities to fully repeatable automation workflows.

- **Multi-language**: PowerShell, Bash, Python, Node.js, and more.
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, and macOS (when applicable).
- **Action-oriented**: Each recipe solves a well-defined task with minimal setup.

## 📌 Notes
- Recipes are opinionated in style but flexible in usage.
- Dependencies are kept minimal unless required for the task.
- Always run scripts in a safe/test environment before production.

## 🙏 Thanks & Credits
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is a great tool for managing automation tasks. Think of it like an alternative to [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a versatile and powerful scripting language for Windows. Call it verbose, but has a very gradual learning curve and a large community.
